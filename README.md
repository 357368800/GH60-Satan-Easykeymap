##All credit goes to dhowland (https://github.com/dhowland) for the awesome tool.

#First commit 11/09/2016

Included are the layout files and firmware for the first fully working config for my GH60 Satan HHKB clone.

I have created this as a backup and for anyone having issues configuring such a layout using Easykeymap as there are some peculiarities.
Mainly the reversal of the Fn and right shift keys.

Updates to the layout will be added as separate layout and firmware files.

v1.30 is my "starting point" layout. Be aware that although this mostly matches the keycaps included with many kits, there are some alterations.

v1.31 adds winlock with the key combination Fn + Win (I got fed up with hitting win instead of alt when playing DotA2.)
